## Group Project- Module20


✓ Selected topic
Spotify Genre Classification 

✓ Reason why they selected their topic
We selected this Topic because we are all interested in how various metrics play into song classification.  

✓ Description of their source of data
This data is sourced form a Spotify API, obtained through Kaggle 

✓ Questions they hope to answer with the data
Do tracks line up with assigned genre determined by a machine learning algorithm.


✓ Description of the communication protocols 

We will commuicating via Slack and planning to assess where we are Wednesday nights and plan out a time to meet if needed.

Breakdown of responsiblities 
* All Work done together for Deliverable 1
## Segment #2

✓ Description of the communication protocols 

All communication within the group took place in either Slack or during our the usual class time where we were split it to meet with each other.

✓ Basic outline of the project

Our project focuses on classification. We look at how different attributes such as the duration of a song or its instrumental (just to name a few) influences its classification using the unsupervised machine learning method. 
The links below include our slides and draft of the dashboard that will be included in our final one.

GitHub part of Rubric
Main Branch All code in the main branch is productionready.
Main branch should include: 
✓ All code necessary to perform exploratory
analysis 
✓ Most code necessary to complete the
machine learning portion of the project
README.md README.md must include: 
✓ Description of the communication
protocols has been removed
✓ Cohesive, structured outline of the project
(this may include images, but should be easy
to follow and digest)
✓ Link to Google Slides draft presentation
Note: The descriptions and explanations
required in all other project deliverables
should also be in your README.md as part
of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

Individual Branches
✓ At least one branch for each team member 
✓ Each team member has at least four
commits for the duration of the the project


ML Part of Rubric
Team members submit the working code for
their machine learning model, as well as the
following:
✓ Description of data preprocessing 
✓ Description of feature engineering and the
feature selection, including their decisionmaking process 
✓ Description of how data was split into
training and testing sets 
✓ Explanation of model choice, including
limitations and benefits 
✓ Explanation of changes in model choice (if
changes occurred between the Segment 2
and Segment 3 deliverables)
✓ Description of how they have trained the
model thus far, and any additional training
that will take place 
✓ Description of current accuracy score
Additionally, the model obviously addresses
the question or problem the team is solving.
